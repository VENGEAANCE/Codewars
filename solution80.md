Please review the question from yesterday including our solution here: https://replit.com/@leonanoel/jewels-stones-huntober2022

Then try tackling tomorrow's question!

 
Given a string of characters, return the character that appears the most often.

describe("Max Character", () => {
 it("Should return max character", () => {
  assert.equal(max("Hello World!"), "l");
 });
});

No String or Array Methods (well brute force it first, but then no methods)! 


Hint: Use the "hash map" pattern from previous questions aka put each character in an object with its count and then find the highest by looping through
